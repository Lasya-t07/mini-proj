Supply Chain Finance (SCF) is a type of supplier finance that enables the supplier to serve their receivables earlier than the actual payment date, thereby freeing up its working capital and also benefits the buyer as the buyer can obtain short-term credit at a lesser cost. Delayed payments by buyers pose a significant threat to supply chain stability. Thus, identifying potential supplier liquidity is crucial.

This work addressed this issue by developing a finance risk prediction model using XGBoost and examined by customer transaction behavior. 
In this work there was a comparative analysis for risk assessment using various machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and LightGBM also hybrid models incoperated with Linear regression.

In this work, we would like to prove that XGBOOST is giving higher F1 score when compared with all the single and hybrid models and also deep learning models. So we deployed a web page using XGBOOST model and made a user convenient website for evaluating their risk.
The following are the improvised results obtained for XGBOOST:

The project is deployed as website using flask and here are the amazing outcomes:
